    (<span class="emphasis"><em>AOP</em></span>) complements Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
    by providing another way of thinking about program structure. In addition
    to classes, AOP gives you <span class="emphasis"><em>aspects</em></span>. Aspects
    enable modularization of concerns such as transaction management that
    cut across multiple types and objects. (Such concerns are often
    termed <span class="emphasis"><em>crosscutting</em></span> concerns.)</p><p>One of the key components of Spring is the <span class="emphasis"><em>AOP
    framework</em></span>. While the Spring IoC container does not depend on AOP,
    meaning you don't need to use AOP if you don't want to, AOP complements
    Spring IoC to provide a very capable middleware solution.</p><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Spring 2.0 AOP</b></p><p>Spring 2.0 introduces a simpler and more powerful
        way of writing custom aspects using either a schema-based approach
        or the @AspectJ annotation style. Both of these styles offer fully
        typed advice and use of the AspectJ pointcut language, while still using
        Spring AOP for weaving.</p><p>The Spring 2.0 schema and @AspectJ based AOP support
        is discussed in this chapter. See section <a href="aop.html#aop-choosing" title="6.4.&nbsp;Choosing which AOP declaration style to use">
        "choosing which AOP declaration style to use"</a> for advice on choosing the
        appropriate style for your application. Spring 2.0 remains fully backwards compatible
        with Spring 1.2 and the lower-level AOP support offered by the Spring 1.2
        APIs is discussed in <a href="aop-api.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;7.&nbsp;Spring AOP APIs">the next chapter</a>.</p></div><p>AOP is used in Spring:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>To provide declarative enterprise services, especially as a
        replacement for EJB declarative services. The most important such
        service is
        <a href="transaction.html#transaction-declarative" title="9.5.&nbsp;Declarative transaction management"><span class="emphasis"><em>declarative transaction management</em></span></a>,
        which builds on Spring's transaction abstraction.</p></li><li><p>To allow users to implement custom aspects, complementing their
        use of OOP with AOP.</p></li></ul></div><p>Thus you can view Spring AOP as either an enabling technology that
    allows Spring to provide declarative transaction management without EJB;
    or use the full power of the Spring AOP framework to implement custom
    aspects.</p><p>
    This chapter first <a href="aop.html#aop-introduction-defn" title="6.1.1.&nbsp;AOP concepts">introduces AOP concepts</a>,
    which you will want to read whichever style of aspect declaration
    you choose to use. The remainder of the chapter focuses on the Spring 2.0 AOP 
    support; see <a href="aop-api.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;7.&nbsp;Spring AOP APIs">the following chapter</a> for an overview of
    the Spring 1.2 style AOP, which you may well encounter in books, articles, and
    existing applications.
    </p><i><span class="remark">If you are interested only in generic declarative services or
    other pre-packaged declarative middleware services such as pooling, you
    don't need to work directly with Spring AOP, and can skip most of this
    chapter.</span></i><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="aop-introduction-defn"></a>6.1.1.&nbsp;AOP concepts</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>Let us begin by defining some central AOP concepts. These terms
      are not Spring-specific. Unfortunately, AOP terminology is not
      particularly intuitive; however, it would be even more confusing if
      Spring used its own terminology.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Aspect</em></span>: A modularization of a concern 
          that cuts across multiple objects. Transaction management is a good example 
		  of a crosscutting concern in J2EE applications. In Spring AOP, aspects are 
		  implemented using regular classes (the schema-based approach) or regular
		  classes annotated with the <tt class="interfacename">@Aspect</tt> annotation
		  (<tt class="interfacename">@AspectJ</tt> style).</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Join point</em></span>: A point during the execution of
          a program, such as the execution of a method or the handling of 
          an exception. In Spring AOP, a join point <span class="emphasis"><em>always</em></span> represents
          a method execution. Join point information is available in advice
          bodies by declaring a parameter of type <tt class="interfacename">org.aspectj.lang.JoinPoint</tt>.
          </p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Advice</em></span>: Action taken by an aspect
          at a particular join point. Different types of advice include
          "around," "before" and "after" advice. Advice types are discussed
          below. Many AOP frameworks, including Spring, model an advice as an
          <span class="emphasis"><em>interceptor</em></span>, maintaining a chain of
          interceptors "around" the join point.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Pointcut</em></span>: A predicate that matches join points.
          Advice is associated with a pointcut expression and runs at any join
          point matched by the pointcut (for example, the execution of a method with
          a certain name). The concept of join points as matched by pointcut
		  expressions is central to AOP: Spring uses the AspectJ pointcut language by default.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Introduction</em></span>: (Also known as an 
          inter-type declaration). Declaring additional methods or fields on
          behalf of a type. Spring allows you to introduce new interfaces 
		  (and a corresponding implementation) to
          any proxied object. For example, you could use an introduction to
          make a bean implement an <tt class="literal">IsModified</tt>
          interface, to simplify caching.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Target object</em></span>: Object being advised
          by one or more aspects. Also referred to as the <span class="emphasis"><em>advised</em></span>
		  object. Since Spring AOP is implemented using runtime proxies, this object
		  will always be a <span class="emphasis"><em>proxied</em></span> object.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>AOP proxy</em></span>: Object created by the AOP
          framework in order to implement the aspect contracts (advise method
          executions and so on). In Spring, an AOP proxy will be a JDK
          dynamic proxy or a CGLIB proxy. <i><span class="remark"> Note: proxy creation is
		  transparent to users of the schema-based and @AspectJ styles of
		  aspect declaration introduced in Spring 2.0</span></i></p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Weaving</em></span>: Linking aspects with other
          application types or objects to create an
          advised object. This can be done at compile time (using the AspectJ
          compiler, for example), load time, or at runtime. Spring, like other pure Java
          AOP frameworks, performs weaving at runtime.</p></li></ul></div><p>Types of advice:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Before advice</em></span>: Advice that executes
          before a join point, but which does not have the ability to prevent
          execution flow proceeding to the join point (unless it throws an
          exception).</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>After returning advice</em></span>: Advice to be
          executed after a join point completes normally: for example, if a
          method returns without throwing an exception.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>After throwing advice</em></span>: Advice to be executed if a
          method exits by throwing an exception.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>After (finally) advice</em></span>: Advice to be executed regardless
          of the means by which a join point exits (normal or exceptional return).</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Around advice</em></span>: Advice that surrounds a
          join point such as a method invocation. This is the most powerful
          kind of advice. Around advice can perform custom behavior before
          and after the method invocation. It is also responsible for choosing
          whether to proceed to the join point or to shortcut executing by
          returning its own return value or throwing an exception.</p></li></ul></div><p>Around advice is the most general kind of advice. Most
      interception-based AOP frameworks, such as Nanning Aspects, provide only
      around advice.</p><p>As Spring, like AspectJ, provides a full range of advice types, we
      recommend that you use the least powerful advice type that can implement
      the required behavior. For example, if you need only to update a cache
      with the return value of a method, you are better off implementing an
      after returning advice than an around advice, although an around advice
      can accomplish the same thing. Using the most specific advice type
      provides a simpler programming model with less potential for errors. For
      example, you don't need to invoke the <tt class="literal">proceed()</tt>
      method on the <tt class="interfacename">JoinPoint</tt> used for around advice, and hence can't
      fail to invoke it.</p><p>In Spring 2.0, all advice parameters are statically typed, so that you work with
	  advice parameters of the appropriate type (the type of the return value
	  from a method execution for example) rather than Object arrays.</p><p>The concept of join points, matched by pointcuts, is the key to AOP
	  which distinguishes it from older technologies offering only interception. 
	  Pointcuts enable advice to be
      targeted independently of the OO hierarchy. For example, an around
      advice providing declarative transaction management can be applied to a
      set of methods spanning multiple objects (such as all business operations
      in the service layer).</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="aop-introduction-spring-defn"></a>6.1.2.&nbsp;Spring AOP capabilities and goals</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>Spring AOP is implemented in pure Java. There is no need for a
      special compilation process. Spring AOP does not need to control the
      class loader hierarchy, and is thus suitable for use in a J2EE web
      container or application server.</p><p>Spring currently supports only method execution join points 
      (advising the execution of methods on Spring beans).
      Field interception is not implemented, although support for field
      interception could be added without breaking the core Spring AOP
      APIs. If you need to advise field
      access and update join points, consider a language such as AspectJ.</p><p>Spring's approach to AOP differs from that of most other AOP
      frameworks. The aim is not to provide the most complete AOP
      implementation (although Spring AOP is quite capable); it is rather to
      provide a close integration between AOP implementation and Spring IoC to
      help solve common problems in enterprise applications.</p><p>Thus, for example, Spring's AOP functionality is normally used in
      conjunction with a Spring IoC container. Aspects are configured using
      normal bean definition syntax (although this allows powerful
      "autoproxying" capabilities): a crucial difference from other AOP
      implementations. There are some things you can't do easily or
      efficiently with Spring AOP, such as advise very fine-grained objects.
      AspectJ is the best choice in such cases. However, our
      experience is that Spring AOP provides an excellent solution to most
      problems in J2EE applications that are amenable to AOP.</p><p>Spring AOP will never strive to compete with AspectJ to provide 
	  a comprehensive AOP solution. We believe that
      both proxy-based frameworks like Spring and full-blown frameworks such
      as AspectJ are valuable, and that they are complementary, rather than in
      competition. Spring 2.0 seamlessly
      integrates Spring AOP and IoC with AspectJ, to enable all uses of AOP
      to be catered for within a consistent Spring-based application
      architecture. This integration does not affect the Spring AOP API or the
      AOP Alliance API; Spring AOP remains backward-compatible. See the following
      chapter for a discussion of the Spring AOP APIs.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="aop-introduction-proxies"></a>6.1.3.&nbsp;AOP Proxies in Spring</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>Spring defaults to using J2SE <span class="emphasis"><em>dynamic proxies</em></span>
      for AOP proxies. This enables any interface or set of interfaces to be
      proxied.</p><p>Spring can also use CGLIB proxies. This is necessary to proxy
      classes, rather than interfaces. CGLIB is used by default if a business
      object doesn't implement an interface. As it's good practice to
      <span class="emphasis"><em>program to interfaces rather than classes</em></span>, business
      objects normally will implement one or more business interfaces.
      It is possible to <a href="aop.html#aop-autoproxy-force-CGLIB">force the use of CGLIB</a>,
      in those (hopefully rare) cases where you need to advise a method that
      is not declared on an interface, or where you need to pass a proxied object
      to a method as a concrete type.</p><i><span class="remark">
        <p>Beyond Spring 2.0, Spring may offer additional types of AOP
        proxy, including wholly generated classes. This won't affect the
        programming model.</p>

    Java 5 annotations. The @AspectJ style was introduced by the 
    <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj" target="_top">AspectJ project</a> as part of
    the AspectJ 5 release. Spring 2.0 interprets the same annotations as AspectJ 5,
    using a library supplied by AspectJ for pointcut parsing and matching. The AOP runtime
    is still pure Spring AOP though, and there is no dependency on the AspectJ compiler
    or weaver.</p><i><span class="remark">
	    <p>Using the AspectJ compiler and weaver enables use of the full AspectJ language,
		and is discussed in <a href="aop.html#aop-using-aspectj" title="6.8.&nbsp;Using AspectJ with Spring applications">Section&nbsp;6.8, &#8220;Using AspectJ with Spring applications&#8221;</a>.</p>

        support for configuring Spring AOP based on @AspectJ aspects, and 
        <span class="emphasis"><em>autoproxying</em></span> beans based on whether or not they are advised by
        those aspects. By autoproxying we mean that if Spring determines that a bean is advised
        by one or more aspects, it will automatically generate a proxy for that bean to intercept
        method invocations and ensure that advice is executed as needed. 
        </p><p>The @AspectJ support is enabled by including the following element inside
        your spring configuration:</p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;aop:aspectj-autoproxy/&gt;</pre><p>This assumes that you are using schema support as described in
        <a href="xsd-config.html" title="Appendix&nbsp;A.&nbsp;XML Schema-based configuration">Appendix&nbsp;A, <i>XML Schema-based configuration</i></a>. See <a href="xsd-config.html#xsd-config-body-schemas-aop" title="A.2.6.&nbsp;The aop schema">Section&nbsp;A.2.6, &#8220;The aop schema&#8221;</a> 
        for how to import the tags in the aop namespace.</p><p>If you are using the DTD, it is still possible to enable @AspectJ support by
        adding the following definition to your application context:</p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;bean class="org.springframework.aop.aspectj.annotation.AnnotationAwareAspectJAutoProxyCreator" /&gt;</pre><p>You will also need two AspectJ libraries on the classpath of your application:
        <tt class="literal">aspectjweaver.jar</tt> and <tt class="literal">aspectjrt.jar</tt>. These libraries
        are available in the <tt class="literal">lib</tt> directory of an AspectJ installation (version
        1.5.1 or later required), or in the <tt class="literal">lib/aspectj</tt> directory of the
        Spring-with-dependencies distribution.
        </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e7726"></a>6.2.2.&nbsp;Declaring an aspect</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>With the @AspectJ support enabled, any bean defined in your application context
      with a class that is an @AspectJ aspect (has the <tt class="interfacename">@Aspect</tt>
      annotation) will be automatically detected by Spring and used to configure Spring AOP.
      The following example shows the minimal definition required for a not-very-useful
      aspect:</p><p>A regular bean definition in the application context, pointing to a bean class
      that has the <tt class="interfacename">@Aspect</tt> annotation:</p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;bean id="myAspect" class="org.xyz.NotVeryUsefulAspect"&gt;

public class NotVeryUsefulAspect {

	  to control when advice executes. <span class="emphasis"><em>Spring AOP only supports method execution
	  join points for Spring beans</em></span>, so you can think of a pointcut as matching
	  the execution of methods on Spring beans. A pointcut declaration has two parts: a
	  signature comprising a name and any parameters, and an attendant pointcut expression
	  that actually determines exactly which method executions we are interested in. In the
	  @AspectJ annotation-style of AOP, a pointcut signature is provided by a regular method
	  definition, and the pointcut expression is indicated using the
	  <tt class="interfacename">@Pointcut</tt> annotation (the method serving as the pointcut
	  signature <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> have a <tt class="literal">void</tt> return
	  type).</p><p>An example will help make this distinction between a pointcut signature and a
	  pointcut expression clear. The following example defines a pointcut named
	  <tt class="literal">'anyOldTransfer'</tt> that will match the execution of any method named

	  Pointcut expressions can be combined using '&amp;&amp;', '||' and '!'. It is also possible
	  to refer to pointcut expressions by name. The following example shows three pointcut 
	  expressions: <tt class="literal">anyPublicOperation</tt> (which matches if a method execution
	  join point represents the execution of any public method); <tt class="literal">inTrading</tt> (which matches
	  if a method execution is in the trading module), and <tt class="literal">tradingOperation</tt>
	  (which matches if a method execution represents any public method in the trading module).

     </p><pre class="programlisting">execution(modifiers-pattern? ret-type-pattern declaring-type-pattern? name-pattern(param-pattern)
          throws-pattern?)</pre><p>
     All parts except the returning type pattern (ret-type-pattern in the snippet above),
	 name pattern, and parameters pattern are optional.
     The returning type pattern determines what the return type of the method must be in order
     for a join point to be matched. Most frequently you will use <tt class="literal">*</tt> as the
     returning type pattern, which matches any return type. A fully-qualified type name will
     match only when the method returns the given type. The name pattern matches the method name.
     You can use the <tt class="literal">*</tt> wildcard as all or part of a name pattern. The
     parameters pattern is slightly more complex: <tt class="literal">()</tt> matches a method that takes
     no parameters, whereas <tt class="literal">(..)</tt> matches any number of parameters (zero or more).
     The pattern <tt class="literal">(*)</tt> matches a method taking one parameter of any type,
     <tt class="literal">(*,String)</tt> matches a method taking two parameters, the first can be of
     any type, the second must be a String. Consult the

	matched method execution. It has the opportunity to do work both before and 
	after the method executes, and to determine when, how, and even if, the method
	actually gets to execute at all. Around advice is often used if you need to 
	share state before and after a method execution in a thread-safe manner (starting
	and stopping a timer for example). Always use the least powerful form of 
	advice that meets your requirements (i.e. don't use around advice if simple
	before advice would do).
	</p><p>Around advice is declared using the <tt class="interfacename">@Around</tt> annotation. The first parameter
	of the advice method must be of type <tt class="interfacename">ProceedingJoinPoint</tt>. Within the body of the
	advice, calling <tt class="literal">proceed()</tt> on the <tt class="interfacename">ProceedingJoinPoint</tt> causes the
	underlying method to execute. The <tt class="literal">proceed</tt> method may also be
	called passing in an <tt class="classname">Object[]</tt> - the values in the array will be used as the arguments
	to the method execution when it proceeds.
	</p><i><span class="remark">The behavior of proceed when called with an <tt class="classname">Object[]</tt> is a little different
	than the behavior of proceed for around advice compiled by the AspectJ compiler. For
	around advice written using the traditional AspectJ language, the number of arguments 
	passed to proceed must match the number of arguments passed to the around advice (not the 
	number of arguments taken by the underlying join point), and the value passed to proceed
	in a given argument position supplants the original value at the join point for the entity
	the value was bound to. (Don't worry if this doesn't make sense right now!) The 
	approach taken by Spring is simpler and a better match to its proxy-based, execution only
	semantics. You only need to be aware of this difference if you compiling @AspectJ aspects
	written for Spring and using proceed with arguments with the AspectJ compiler and weaver.
	There is a way to write such aspects that is 100% compatible across both Spring AOP and 
	AspectJ, and this is discussed in the following section on advice parameters. 
	</span></i><pre class="programlisting">import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect;

    // stop stopwatch
    return retVal;
  }

}</pre><p>
	The value returned by the around advice will be the return value seen by the caller
	of the method. A simple caching aspect for example could return a value from a cache
	if it has one, and invoke proceed() if it does not. Note that proceed may be invoked
	once, many times, or not at all within the body of the around advice, all of these
	are quite legal.

	   	join point? Spring AOP follows the same precedence rules as AspectJ to determine
	   	the order of advice execution. The highest precedence advice runs first "on the way in"
	   	(so given two pieces of before advice, the one with highest precedence runs
	   	first). "On the way out" from a join point, the highest precedence advice runs last
	   	(so given two pieces of after advice, the one with the highest precedence will run
	   	second). For advice defined within the same aspect, precedence is established
	   	by declaration order. Given the aspect:</p><pre class="programlisting">@Aspect
public class AspectWithMultipleAdviceDeclarations {

  @Pointcut("execution(* foo(..))")
  public void fooExecution() {}
  
  @Before("fooExecution()")
  public void doBeforeOne() {
    // ...
  }
  
  @Before("fooExecution()")
  public void doBeforeTwo() {
    // ...
  }
  
  @AfterReturning("fooExecution()")
  public void doAfterOne() {
    // ...
  }

  @AfterReturning("fooExecution()")
  public void doAfterTwo() {
    // ...
  }

}</pre><p>then for any execution of a method named foo, the <tt class="literal">doBeforeOne</tt>,
	    <tt class="literal">doBeforeTwo</tt>, <tt class="literal">doAfterOne</tt>, and <tt class="literal">doAfterTwo</tt>
	    advice methods all need to run. The precedence rules are such that the advice will execute
	    in declaration order. In this case the execution trace would be:</p><pre class="programlisting">doBeforeOne
doBeforeTwo
foo
doAfterOne
doAfterTwo
</pre><p>In other words doBeforeOne has precedence over doBeforeTwo, because it was defined
        before doBeforeTwo, and doAfterTwo has precedence over doAfterOne because it was defined
        after doAfterOne. It's easiest just to remember that advice runs in declaration order ;) - 
        see the AspectJ Programming Guide for full details.</p><p>When two pieces of advice defined in <span class="emphasis"><em>different</em></span> aspects both need
        to run at the same join point, unless you specify otherwise the order of execution is 
        undefined. You can control the order of execution by specifying precedence. This is done in 
        the normal Spring way by implementing the <tt class="interfacename">org.springframework.core.Ordered</tt>
        interface in the aspect class. Given two aspects, the aspect returning the lower value from
        <tt class="literal">Ordered.getValue()</tt> has the higher precedence.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e8419"></a>6.2.5.&nbsp;Introductions</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>Introductions (known as inter-type declarations in AspectJ) enable an aspect
	to declare that advised objects implement a given interface, and to provide an implementation
	of that interface on behalf of those objects.</p><p>An introduction is made using the <tt class="interfacename">@DeclareParents</tt> annotation. This annotation is
	used to declare that matching types have a new parent (hence the name). For example, given
	an interface <tt class="interfacename">UsageTracked</tt>, and an implementation of that interface
	<tt class="classname">DefaultUsageTracked</tt>, the following
	aspect declares that all implementors of service interfaces also implement the
	<tt class="interfacename">UsageTracked</tt> interface.
	(In order to expose statistics via JMX for example.)
	</p><pre class="programlisting">@Aspect
public class UsageTracking {

  @DeclareParents(value="com.xzy.myapp.service.*+",

}</pre><p>
	The interface to be implemented is determined by the type of the annotated field. The 
	<tt class="literal">value</tt> attribute of the <tt class="interfacename">@DeclareParents</tt> annotation
	is an AspectJ type pattern :- any bean of a matching type will implement the UsageTracked
	interface. Note that in the before advice of the above example, service
	beans can be directly used as implementations of the <tt class="interfacename">UsageTracked</tt> interface. If accessing
	a bean programmatically you would write the following:

	context. AspectJ calls this the singleton instantiation model. It is possible to define
	aspects with alternate lifecycles :- Spring supports AspectJ's <tt class="literal">perthis</tt>
	and <tt class="literal">pertarget</tt> instantiation models (<tt class="literal">percflow, percflowbelow,</tt>
	and <tt class="literal">pertypewithin</tt> are not currently supported).
	</p><p>A "perthis" aspect is declared by specifying a <tt class="literal">perthis</tt> clause
	in the <tt class="interfacename">@Aspect</tt> annotation. Let's look at an example, and then
	we'll explain how it works.
	</p><pre class="programlisting">@Aspect("perthis(com.xyz.myapp.SystemArchitecture.businessService())")
public class MyAspect {

  private int someState;
	
  @Before(com.xyz.myapp.SystemArchitecture.businessService())
  public void recordServiceUsage() {
    // ...
  }
  	
}</pre><p>The effect of the perthis clause is that one aspect instance will be created for
	each unique service object executing a business service (each unique object
	bound to 'this' at join points matched by the pointcut expression). 
	The aspect instance is created
	the first time that a method is invoked on the service object. The aspect goes out
	of scope when the service object goes out of scope. Before the aspect instance is created,
	none of the advice within it executes. As soon as the aspect instance has been created,
	the advice declared within it will execute at matched join points, but only when the service
	object is the one this aspect is associated with. See the AspectJ programming guide for
	more information on per-clauses. 
	</p><p>The 'pertarget' instantiation model works in exactly the same way as perthis, but
	creates one aspect instance for each unique target object at matched join points.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="aop-ataspectj-example"></a>6.2.7.&nbsp;Example</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
      Now that you've seen how all the constituent parts work, let's put them together
      to do something useful!</p><p>The execution of business services can sometimes fail
      due to concurrency issues (for example, deadlock loser).
      If the operation is retried, it is quite likely to succeed next time round. For
      business services where it is appropriate to retry in such conditions (idempotent
      operations that don't need to go back to the user for conflict resolution), we'd like
      to transparently retry the operation to avoid the client seeing a 
      <tt class="classname">PessimisticLockingFailureException</tt>. This is a requirement that clearly cuts across
      multiple services in the service layer, and hence is ideal for implementing via an aspect.
      </p><p>Because we want to retry the operation, we'll need to use around advice so
      that we can call proceed multiple times. Here's how the basic aspect implementation
      looks:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">@Aspect
public class ConcurrentOperationExecutor implements Ordered {
   
   private static final int DEFAULT_MAX_RETRIES = 2;

   private int maxRetries = DEFAULT_MAX_RETRIES;
   private int order = 1;

   public void setMaxRetries(int maxRetries) {
      this.maxRetries = maxRetries;
   }
   
   public int getOrder() {
      return this.order;
   }
   
   public void setOrder(int order) {
      this.order = order;
   }
   
   @Around("com.xyz.myapp.SystemArchitecture.businessService()")
   public Object doConcurrentOperation(ProceedingJoinPoint pjp) throws Throwable { 
      int numAttempts = 0;
      PessimisticLockingFailureException lockFailureException;
      do {
         numAttempts++;
         try { 
            return pjp.proceed();
         }
         catch(PessimisticLockingFailureException ex) {
            lockFailureException = ex;
         }
      }
      while(numAttempts &lt;= this.maxRetries);
      throw lockFailureException;
   }

}</pre><p>Note that the aspect implements the <tt class="interfacename">Ordered</tt> interface so we can set the precedence
      of the aspect higher than the transaction advice (we want a fresh transaction
      each time we retry). The <tt class="literal">maxRetries</tt> and <tt class="literal">order</tt>
      properties will both be configured by Spring. The main action happens in the
      <tt class="literal">doConcurrentOperation</tt> around advice. Notice that for the moment
      we're applying the retry logic to all <tt class="literal">businessService()s</tt>. We
      try to proceed, and if we fail with an <tt class="classname">PessimisticLockingFailureException</tt>
      we simply try again unless we have exhausted all of our retry attempts.
      </p><p>The corresponding Spring configuration is:</p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;aop:aspectj-autoproxy/&gt;

&lt;bean id="concurrentOperationExecutor"
  class="com.xyz.myapp.service.impl.ConcurrentOperationExecutor"&gt;
     &lt;property name="maxRetries" value="3"/&gt;
     &lt;property name="order" value="100"/&gt;  
&lt;/bean&gt;</pre><p>To refine the aspect so that it only retries idempotent operations, we might
       define an <tt class="interfacename">Idempotent</tt> annotation:</p><pre class="programlisting">@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface Idempotent {
  <i class="lineannotation"><span class="lineannotation">// marker annotation</span></i>
}</pre><p>and use the annotation to annotate the implementation of service operations.
       The change to the aspect to only retry idempotent operations simply involves
       refining the pointcut expression so that only <tt class="interfacename">@Idempotent</tt> operations match:</p><pre class="programlisting">@Around("com.xyz.myapp.SystemArchitecture.businessService() &amp;&amp; " + 
        "@annotation(com.xyz.myapp.service.Idempotent)")

	actually gets to execute at all. Around advice is often used if you need to 
	share state before and after a method execution in a thread-safe manner (starting
	and stopping a timer for example).  Always use the least powerful form of

}</pre><p>Next up is the (admittedly simple) aspect. Notice the fact that the
    <tt class="methodname">profile(..)</tt> method accepts a number of strongly-typed parameters,
    the first of which happens to be the join point used to proceed with the method call: the
    presence of this parameter is an indication that the <tt class="methodname">profile(..)</tt>
    is to be used as <tt class="literal">around</tt> advice:</p><pre class="programlisting">package x.y;

	like a small self-contained aspect that has a single piece of advice. The advice
	itself is represented by a bean, and must implement one of the advice 
	interfaces described in <a href="aop-api.html#aop-api-advice-types" title="7.3.2.&nbsp;Advice types in Spring">Section&nbsp;7.3.2, &#8220;Advice types in Spring&#8221;</a>. Advisors can

	element. You will most commonly see it used in conjunction with transactional advice, 
	which also has its own namespace support in Spring 2.0. Here's how it looks:

	</p><p>The execution of business services can sometimes fail
      due to concurrency issues (for example, deadlock loser).
      If the operation is retried, it is quite likely it will succeed next time round. For
      business services where it is appropriate to retry in such conditions (idempotent
      operations that don't need to go back to the user for conflict resolution), we'd like
      to transparently retry the operation to avoid the client seeing a 
      <tt class="classname">PessimisticLockingFailureException</tt>. This is a requirement that clearly cuts across
      multiple services in the service layer, and hence is ideal for implementing via an aspect.
      </p><p>Because we want to retry the operation, we'll need to use around advice so
      that we can call proceed multiple times. Here's how the basic aspect implementation
      looks (it's just a regular Java class using the schema support):
      </p><pre class="programlisting">public class ConcurrentOperationExecutor implements Ordered {
   
   private static final int DEFAULT_MAX_RETRIES = 2;

   private int maxRetries = DEFAULT_MAX_RETRIES;
   private int order = 1;

      this.maxRetries = maxRetries;
   }
   
   public int getOrder() {
      return this.order;
   }
   
   public void setOrder(int order) {
      this.order = order;
   }
   
   public Object doConcurrentOperation(ProceedingJoinPoint pjp) throws Throwable { 
      int numAttempts = 0;
      PessimisticLockingFailureException lockFailureException;
      do {
         numAttempts++;
         try { 
            return pjp.proceed();

         catch(PessimisticLockingFailureException ex) {
            lockFailureException = ex;
         }
      }
      while(numAttempts &lt;= this.maxRetries);
      throw lockFailureException;
   }

}</pre><p>Note that the aspect implements the <tt class="interfacename">Ordered</tt> interface so we can set the precedence
      of the aspect higher than the transaction advice (we want a fresh transaction
      each time we retry). The <tt class="literal">maxRetries</tt> and <tt class="literal">order</tt>
      properties will both be configured by Spring. The main action happens in the
      <tt class="literal">doConcurrentOperation</tt> around advice method. We
      try to proceed, and if we fail with a <tt class="classname">PessimisticLockingFailureException</tt>
      we simply try again unless we have exhausted all of our retry attempts.
      </p><i><span class="remark">This class is identical to the one used in the @AspectJ example, but

&lt;/bean&gt;</pre><p>Notice that for the time being we assume that all business services
       are idempotent. If this is not the case we can refine the aspect so that it only

public @interface Idempotent {
  <i class="lineannotation"><span class="lineannotation">// marker annotation</span></i>
}</pre><p>and using the annotation to annotate the implementation of service operations.

    Once you have decided that an aspect is the best approach for implementing a 
    given requirement, how do you decide between using Spring AOP or AspectJ, 
    and between the Aspect language (code) style, @AspectJ declaration style, 
    and XML? These decisions are influenced by a number of factors including 
    application requirements, development tools, and team familiarity with AOP. 
    </p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e8978"></a>6.4.1.&nbsp;Spring AOP or full AspectJ?</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
    	Use the simplest thing that can work. Spring AOP is simpler than using 
    	full AspectJ as there is no requirement to introduce the AspectJ 
    	compiler / weaver into your development and build processes. 
    	If you only need to advise the execution of operations on Spring beans, 
    	then Spring AOP is the right choice. If you need to advise domain objects, 
    	or any other object not managed by the Spring container, then you will 
    	need to use AspectJ. You will also need to use AspectJ if you wish to 
    	advise join points other than simple method executions (for example, call 
    	join points, field get or set join points, and so on). 	
    	</p><p>
    	When using AspectJ, you have the choice of the AspectJ language syntax 
    	(also known as the "code style") or the @AspectJ annotation style. 
    	If aspects play a large role in your design, and you are able to use the 
    	AspectJ Development Tools (AJDT) in Eclipse, then the AspectJ language 
    	syntax is the preferred option :- it's cleaner and simpler because the 
    	language was purposefully designed for writing aspects. If you are not using 
    	Eclipse, or have only a few aspects that do not play a major role in your 
    	application, then you may want to consider using the @AspectJ style and 
    	sticking with a regular Java compilation in your IDE, and adding an aspect 
    	weaving (linking) phase to your build scripts.
    	</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e8985"></a>6.4.2.&nbsp;@AspectJ or XML for Spring AOP?</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
    	If you have chosen to use Spring AOP, then you have a choice of 
    	@AspectJ or XML style. On balance we recommend use of the @AspectJ style
    	if you are using Java 5. Clearly if you are not running on Java 5, 
    	then the XML style is the best choice. Details of the trade-offs between 
    	the XML and @AspectJ styles are discussed below.
    	</p><p>
    	The XML style will be most familiar to existing Spring users. It can be 
    	used with any JDK level (referring to named pointcuts from within 
    	pointcut expressions does still require Java 5 though) and is backed 
    	by genuine POJOs. When using AOP as a tool to configure enterprise 
    	services (a good test is whether you consider the pointcut expression 
    	to be a part of your configuration you might want to change independently) 
    	then XML can be a good choice. With the XML style it is arguably 
    	clearer from your configuration what aspects are present in the system. 
    	</p><p>
    	The XML style has two disadvantages. Firstly it does not fully encapsulate 
    	the implementation of the requirement it addresses in a single place. 
    	The DRY principle says that there should be a single, unambiguous, authoritative 
    	representation of any piece of knowledge within a system. When using the 
    	XML style, the knowledge of how a requirement is implemented is split across 
    	the declaration of the backing bean class, and the XML in the configuration 
    	file. When using the @AspectJ style there is a single module - the aspect - in 
    	which this information is encapsulated. Secondly, the XML style is more 
    	limited in what in can express than the @AspectJ style: only the "singleton" 
    	aspect instantiation model is supported, and it is not possible to combine 
    	named pointcuts declared in XML. For example, in the @AspectJ style we 
    	can write something like:
    	</p><pre class="programlisting">  @Pointcut(execution(* get*()))
  public void propertyAccess() {}

  @Pointcut(execution(org.xyz.Account+ *(..))
  public void operationReturningAnAccount() {}

  @Pointcut(propertyAccess() &amp;&amp; operationReturningAnAccount())
  public void accountPropertyAccess() {}</pre><p>In the XML style I can declare the first two pointcuts:</p><pre class="programlisting">  &lt;aop:pointcut id="propertyAccess" 
      expression="execution(* get*())"/&gt;

  &lt;aop:pointcut id="operationReturningAnAccount" 
      expression="execution(org.xyz.Account+ *(..))"/&gt;</pre><p>
	but I cannot define the accountPropertyAccess pointcut by combining these definitions. 
	</p><p>
	The @AspectJ style supports additional instantiation models, and richer 
	pointcut composition. It has the advantage of keeping the aspect as a 
	modular unit. It also has the advantage the @AspectJ aspects can be 
	understood both by Spring AOP and by AspectJ - so if you later decide 
	you need the capabilities of AspectJ to implement additional requirements 
	then it is very easy to migrate to an AspectJ based approach.

		  The Spring container instantiates and configures beans defined in your 
		  application context. It is also possible to ask a bean factory to configure
		  a <span class="emphasis"><em>pre-existing</em></span> object given the name of a bean definition 
		  containing the configuration to be applied. The <tt class="literal">spring-aspects.jar</tt> contains an 
		  annotation-driven aspect that exploits this capability to allow dependency-injection
		  of any object. The support is intended to be used for objects created 
		  <span class="emphasis"><em>outside of the control of any container</em></span>. Domain objects
		  often fall into this category: they may be created programmatically using the
		  <tt class="literal">new</tt> operator, or by an ORM tool as a result of a database query.
		</p><p>
			The <tt class="classname">DependencyInjectionInterceptorFactoryBean</tt>
			in the <tt class="literal">org.springframework.orm.hibernate.support</tt> package
			can be used to have Spring create and configure prototype domain objects for 
			Hibernate (using either autowiring or named prototype bean definitions).
			The interceptor does not of course support 
			configuration of objects that you create yourself programmatically rather than
			retrieve from the database. Similar techniques may be possible with other
			frameworks. As ever, be pragramatic and choose the simplest thing
			that meets your requirements. Please note that the aforementioned class does
			<span class="bold"><b>not</b></span> ship with the Spring distribution. If you
			want to make use of it, you will have to download it from the Spring CVS repository
			and compile it yourself; the file itself can be found in the <tt class="literal">'sandbox'</tt>
			directory of the Spring CVS repository tree.
		</p><p>
		  The <tt class="interfacename">@Configurable</tt> annotation marks a class as eligible for
		  Spring-driven configuration. In the simplest case it can be used just as a 
		  marker annotation:
		</p><pre class="programlisting">package com.xyz.myapp.domain;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Configurable;

@Configurable
public class Account {
   ...
}</pre><p>
			When used simply as a marker interface in this way, Spring will configure
			new instances of the annotated type (<tt class="classname">Account</tt> in this case) using a 
			prototypical bean definition with the same name as the fully-qualified
			type name (<tt class="classname">com.xyz.myapp.domain.Account</tt>). Since the
			default name for a bean is the fully-qualified name of its type, a 
			convenient way to declare the prototype definition is simply to omit the
			id attribute:</p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;bean class="com.xyz.myapp.domain.Account" scope="prototype"&gt;
  &lt;property name="fundsTransferService" ref="fundsTransferService"/&gt;
  ...
&lt;/bean&gt;</pre><p>If you want to explicitly specify the name of the prototype bean 
		definition to use, you can do so directly in the annotation:</p><pre class="programlisting">package com.xyz.myapp.domain;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Configurable;

@Configurable("account")
public class Account {
   ...
}</pre><p>Spring will now look for a bean definition named "account" and 
		use that as a prototypical definition to configure new <tt class="classname">Account</tt>
		instances.</p><p>You can also use autowiring to avoid having to specify a prototypical
		bean definition at all. To have Spring apply autowiring use the 
		autowire property of the <tt class="interfacename">@Configurable</tt> annotation: specify either
		<tt class="literal">@Configurable(autowire=Autowire.BY_TYPE)</tt> or
		<tt class="literal">@Configurable(autowire=Autowire.BY_NAME</tt> for autowiring
		by type or by name respectively.</p><p>Finally you can enable Spring dependency checking for the object references
		in the newly created and configured object by using the <tt class="literal">dependencyCheck</tt>
		attribute (for example: 
			<tt class="literal">@Configurable(autowire=Autowire.BY_NAME,dependencyCheck=true)</tt> ).
		If this attribute is set to true, then Spring will validate after configuration that all properties
		(<span class="emphasis"><em>that are not primitives or collections</em></span>) have been set.
		</p><p>Merely using the annotation on its own does nothing of course. It's the 
		<tt class="literal">AnnotationBeanConfigurerAspect</tt> in spring-aspects.jar that 
		acts on the presence of the annotation. In essence the aspect says "after 
		returning from the initialization of a new object of a type with the 
		<tt class="interfacename">@Configurable</tt> annotation, configure the newly created object using Spring
		in accordance with the properties of the annotation". For this to work the
		annotated types must be woven with the AspectJ weaver - you can either 
		use a build-time ant or maven task to do this (see for example the
		<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/doc/released/devguide/antTasks.html" target="_top">AspectJ 
		Development Environment Guide</a>) or load-time weaving (see <a href="aop.html#aop-aj-ltw" title="6.8.4.&nbsp;Using AspectJ Load-time weaving (LTW) with Spring applications">Section&nbsp;6.8.4, &#8220;Using AspectJ Load-time weaving (LTW) with Spring applications&#8221;</a>).
		</p><p>The <tt class="classname">AnnotationBeanConfigurerAspect</tt> itself needs
		configuring by Spring (in order to obtain a reference to the bean factory that
		is to be used to configure new objects). The Spring AOP namespace defines a
		convenient tag for doing this. Simply include the following in your
		application context configuration:</p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;aop:spring-configured/&gt;</pre><p>If you are using the DTD instead of schema, the equivalent definition is:</p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;bean 
  class="org.springframework.beans.factory.aspectj.AnnotationBeanConfigurerAspect"
  factory-method="aspectOf"/&gt;</pre><p>Instances of @Configurable objects created <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span>
		the aspect has been configured will result in a warning being issued to the
		log and no configuration of the object taking place. An example might be 
		a bean in the Spring configuration that creates domain objects when it is 
		initialized by Spring. In this case you can use the "depends-on" bean
		attribute to manually specify that the bean depends on the
		configuration aspect.</p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;bean id="myService"
  class="com.xzy.myapp.service.MyService"
  depends-on="org.springframework.beans.factory.aspectj.AnnotationBeanConfigurerAspect"&gt;
  ...

		  unit testing of domain objects without the difficulties associated with

		  then the annotation has no affect during unit testing, and you can simply
		  set mock or stub property references in the object under test and proceed
		  as normal. If <tt class="interfacename">@Configurable</tt> types <span class="emphasis"><em>have</em></span> been woven by
		  AspectJ then you can still unit test outside of the container as normal,
		  but you will see a warning message each time that you construct an 
		  <tt class="interfacename">@Configurable</tt> object indicating that it has not been configured by Spring.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e9239"></a>6.8.1.2.&nbsp;Working with multiple application contexts</h4></div></div><div></div></div><p>The <tt class="literal">AnnotationBeanConfigurerAspect</tt> used to implement
		  the <tt class="interfacename">@Configurable</tt> support is an AspectJ singleton aspect. The scope of a 
		  singleton aspect is the same as the scope of static members, i.e. there is 
		  one aspect instance per classloader that defines the type. This means that if
		  you define multiple application contexts within the same classloader hierarchy
		  you need to consider where to define the 
		  <tt class="literal">&lt;aop:spring-configured/&gt;</tt> bean and where to place
		  spring-aspects.jar on the classpath.</p><p>
			  Consider a typical Spring web-app configuration with a shared parent application
			  context defining common business services and everything needed to support
			  them, and one child application context per servlet containing definitions
			  particular to that servlet. All of these contexts will co-exist within the 
			  same classloader hierarchy, and so the <tt class="literal">AnnotationBeanConfigurerAspect</tt>
			  can only hold a reference to one of them. In this case we recommend
			  defining the <tt class="literal">&lt;aop:spring-configured/&gt;</tt> bean in the
			  shared (parent) application context: this defines the services that you are
			  likely to want to inject into domain objects. A consequence is that you cannot
			  configure domain objects with references to beans defined in the child 
			  (servlet-specific) contexts using the @Configurable mechanism 
			  (probably not something you want to do anyway!).
		  </p><p>
			  When deploying multiple web-apps within the same container, ensure that each
			  web-application loads the types in spring-aspects.jar using its own classloader
			  (for example, by placing spring-aspects.jar in WEB-INF/lib). If spring-aspects.jar
			  is only added to the container wide classpath (and hence loaded by the shared
			  parent classloader), all web applications will share the same aspect instance
			  which is probably not what you want.

		AspectJ aspect that can be used to drive Spring's transaction management for
		types and methods annotated with the @Transactional annotation. 
		This is primarily intended for users
		who want to use Spring's transaction support outside of the Spring container.</p><p>The aspect that interprets @Transactional annotations is the
		<tt class="interfacename">AnnotationTransactionAspect</tt>. When using this 
		aspect, you must annotate the <span class="emphasis"><em>implementation</em></span> class 
	    (and/or methods within that class), <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> the interface 
	    (if any) that the class implements. AspectJ follows Java's rule that annotations on 
	    interfaces are <span class="emphasis"><em>not inherited</em></span>.</p><p>A @Transactional annotation on a class specifies the default transaction
        semantics for the execution of any <span class="emphasis"><em>public</em></span> operation in the class.</p><p>A @Transactional annotation on a method within the class overrides the
        default transaction semantics given by the class annotation (if present). 
        Methods with public, protected, and default visibility may all be annotated.
        Annotating protected and default visibility methods directly is the only way
        to get transaction demarcation for the execution of such operations.</p><p>For AspectJ programmers that want to use the Spring configuration and 
		transaction management support but don't want to (or can't) use annotations,
		spring-aspects.jar also contains abstract aspects you can extend to provide
		your own pointcut definitions. See the Javadocs for 
		<tt class="literal">AbstractBeanConfigurerAspect</tt> and 
		<tt class="literal">AbstractTransactionAspect</tt> for more information. As an example,
		the following excerpt shows how you could write an aspect to configure
		all instances of objects defined in the domain model
		using prototypical bean definitions that match the fully-qualified class
		names:</p><pre class="programlisting">public aspect DomainObjectConfiguration extends AbstractBeanConfigurerAspect {

  public DomainObjectConfiguration() {
    setBeanWiringInfoResolver(new ClassNameBeanWiringInfoResolver());
  }

  <i class="lineannotation"><span class="lineannotation">// the creation of a new bean (any object in the domain model)</span></i>
  protected pointcut beanCreation(Object beanInstance) :
    initialization(new(..)) &amp;&amp;
    SystemArchitecture.inDomainModel() &amp;&amp; 
    this(beanInstance);
		   		   
}</pre></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="aop-aj-configure"></a>6.8.3.&nbsp;Configuring AspectJ aspects using Spring IoC</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>When using AspectJ aspects with Spring applications, it's natural to want
		to configure such aspects using Spring. The AspectJ runtime itself is responsible
		for aspect creation, and the means of configuring the AspectJ created aspects via
		Spring depends on the AspectJ instantiation model (per-clause) used by the aspect. 
		</p><p>The majority of AspectJ aspects are
		<span class="emphasis"><em>singleton</em></span> aspects. Configuration of these aspects is very
		easy, simply create a bean definition referencing the aspect type as normal, and 
		include the bean attribute <tt class="literal">'factory-method="aspectOf"'</tt>. This
		ensures that Spring obtains the aspect instance by asking AspectJ for it rather
		than trying to create an instance itself. For example:</p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;bean id="profiler" class="com.xyz.profiler.Profiler"
      factory-method="aspectOf"&gt;
  &lt;property name="profilingStrategy" ref="jamonProfilingStrategy"/&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;</pre><p>For non-singleton aspects, the easiest way to configure them is to create
	   prototypical bean definitions and annotate use the @Configurable support from
	   spring-aspects.jar to configure the aspect instances once they have bean created
	   by the AspectJ runtime.</p><p>If you have some @AspectJ aspects that you want to weave with AspectJ
	   (for example, using load-time weaving for domain model types) and other @AspectJ
	   aspects that you want to use with Spring AOP, and these aspects are all configured
	   using Spring, then you'll need to tell the Spring AOP @AspectJ autoproxying support
	   which subset of the @AspectJ aspects defined in the configuration should be used
	   for autoproxying. You can do this by using one or more <tt class="literal">&lt;include/&gt;</tt>
	   elements inside the <tt class="literal">&lt;aop:aspectj-autoproxy/&gt;</tt> declaration.
	   Each include element specifies a name pattern, and only beans with names matched
	   by at least one of the patterns will be used for Spring AOP autoproxy configuration:</p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;aop:aspectj-autoproxy&gt;
  &lt;include name="thisBean"/&gt;
  &lt;include name="thatBean"/&gt;
&lt;/aop:aspectj-autoproxy&gt;</pre></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="aop-aj-ltw"></a>6.8.4.&nbsp;Using AspectJ Load-time weaving (LTW) with Spring applications</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>Load-time weaving (or LTW) refers to the process of weaving AspectJ aspects
		with an application's class files as they are loaded into the VM. For full details
		on configuring load-time weaving with AspectJ, see the 
		<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/doc/released/devguide/ltw.html" target="_top">
		LTW section of the AspectJ Development Environment Guide
		</a>. We will focus here on the essentials of configuring load-time weaving
		for Spring applications running on Java 5.</p><p>
		Load-time weaving is controlled by defining a file '<tt class="literal">aop.xml</tt>' in
		the META-INF directory. AspectJ automatically looks for all 'META-INF/aop.xml' files
		visible on the classpath and configures itself based on the aggregation of their
		content.
		</p><p>
		A basic META-INF/aop.xml for your application should look like this:
		</p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;!DOCTYPE aspectj PUBLIC    
  "-//AspectJ//DTD//EN"    "http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/dtd/aspectj.dtd"&gt;    

&lt;aspectj&gt;    
   &lt;weaver&gt;
	 &lt;include within="com.xyz.myapp..*"/&gt;
   &lt;/weaver&gt;
&lt;/aspectj&gt;</pre><p>
			The <tt class="literal">&lt;include/&gt;</tt> element tells AspectJ which set of types
			should be included in the weaving process. Use the package prefix for your
			application followed by "..*" (meaning '... and any type defined in a subpackage
			of this') as a good default. Using the include element is important as otherwise
			AspectJ will look at every type loaded in support of your application (including
			all the Spring library classes and many more besides). Normally you don't want
			to weave these types and don't want to pay the overhead of AspectJ attempting
			to match against them.
		</p><p>
			To get informational messages in your log file regarding the activity of the
			load-time weaver, add the following options to the weaver element:
		</p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;!DOCTYPE aspectj PUBLIC    
  "-//AspectJ//DTD//EN"    "http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/dtd/aspectj.dtd"&gt;    

&lt;aspectj&gt;    
   &lt;weaver 
	 options="-showWeaveInfo
              -XmessageHandlerClass:org.springframework.aop.aspectj.AspectJWeaverMessageHandler"&gt;
	 &lt;include within="com.xyz.myapp..*"/&gt;
   &lt;/weaver&gt;
&lt;/aspectj&gt;</pre><p>Finally, to control exactly which aspects are used, you can use the 
	<tt class="literal">aspects</tt> element. By default all defined aspects are used for 
	weaving (spring-aspects.jar contains a META-INF/aop.xml file that defines the
	configuration and transaction aspects). If you were using spring-aspects.jar, but
	only want the configuration support and not the transaction support you could 
	specify this as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;!DOCTYPE aspectj PUBLIC    
  "-//AspectJ//DTD//EN"    "http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/dtd/aspectj.dtd"&gt;    

&lt;aspectj&gt;
  &lt;aspects&gt;
    &lt;include within="org.springframework.beans.factory.aspectj.AnnotationBeanConfigurerAspect"/&gt;
  &lt;/aspects&gt;    
  &lt;weaver 
    options="-showWeaveInfo -XmessageHandlerClass:org.springframework.aop.aspectj.AspectJWeaverMessageHandler"&gt;
    &lt;include within="com.xyz.myapp..*"/&gt;
  &lt;/weaver&gt;
&lt;/aspectj&gt;</pre><p>On the Java 5 platform, load-time weaving is enabled by specifying the following
	VM argument when launching the Java virtual machine:</p><pre class="programlisting">-javaagent:&lt;path-to-ajlibs&gt;/aspectjweaver.jar</pre></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="aop-resources"></a>6.9.&nbsp;Further Resources</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>More information on AspectJ can be found at the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj" target="_top">
